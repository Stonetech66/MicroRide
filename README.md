<h1 align="center">MicroRide</h1>
MicroRide is a cutting-edge and scalable microservice application that showcases a robust implementation of distributed systems and the effective utilization of modern technologies. Designed as a simplified ride application, MicroRide demonstrates key architectural patterns and seamless integration with various tools. Developed as a hands-on project to learn building microservice applications, MicroRide encompasses essential features while providing insights into future enhancements.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Microservice Architecture:** MicroRide follows a microservice architecture, ensuring the system's scalability, modularity, and maintainability. Each service is designed with a specific responsibility, making it easy to scale individual components independently.

- **Asynchronous Communication:** The application leverages RabbitMQ, a robust message broker, to enable asynchronous communication between services. This promotes loose coupling and enhances overall system performance.

- **Efficient Data Storage:** MicroRide uses a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to suit different service requirements. PostgreSQL handles user-account-service,driver-service, payment-service,and ride-service, while MongoDB handles the tracking-service. Redis is utilized as a temporary data store to enhance response time and to improve overall user experience.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** The user-account-service provides a secure and reliable authentication and authorization mechanism. By validating user credentials and storing them in Redis, the application optimizes subsequent requests, reducing latency and ensuring an optimal user experience.

- **Real-time Notifications**: The notification-service employs websockets to deliver real-time notifications to both drivers and users. Whether it's ride cancellations, ride confirmations, driver arrivals, or ride completions, MicroRide ensures timely updates and seamless user experience.

## üìö Services Overview

1. **User Account Service:** Responsible for user registration, login, and authentication. It securely stores user credentials and provides a jwt-token-based authentication mechanism.

2. **Driver Service:** Manages driver-related functionalities, such as driver registration and driver information retrieval.

3. **Ride Service:** Handles ride-related operations, including ride requests, ride confirmations, and ride cancellations. It utilizes RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication with other services.

4. **Payment Service:** The payment service provides endpoints to simulate payment successes and failures. While it doesn't integrate with an actual payment gateway, it enables testing and validation of payment-related functionalities.
   
6. **Tracking Service:** While actual driver tracking is not fully implemented, the tracking service offers essential endpoints to simulate ride progress, such as marking a ride as completed, in-transit, or the driver's arrival. This paves the way for future enhancements in real-time tracking.

7. **Analysis Service:** The analysis service, while not fully functional in its current state, is designed to process and provide valuable data insights. Presently, it fetches random prices and estimated time of arrivals (ETA) from static data, creating a foundation for future advanced analytics.

8. **Notification Service:** Facilitates real-time notifications to users and drivers about various ride events, improving overall user experience and engagement.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend:** The backend of all services is powered by FastAPI, a modern and high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities complement the microservices architecture, ensuring exceptional performance and scalability.
  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL is used for services handling structured data, while MongoDB is utilized for the tracking service's location data storage. Redis acts as a cache for temporary data storage, optimizing performance.

- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ enables efficient asynchronous communication between services, promoting scalability and flexibility.

- **Websockets:** Websockets are employed in the notification service to provide real-time updates to users and drivers, ensuring timely notifications.
  
- **Docker:** Each microservice is containerized using Docker, enabling seamless deployment across various environments.

- **Helm Charts and Helmfile**: Helmfile and Helm charts are utilized to manage the Kubernetes deployments of the microservices,simplifying service management and scalability.
  
- **Kubernetes:** The services are deployed and orchestrated using Kubernetes, facilitating easy scaling and management.
